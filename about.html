            Hi, &nbsp I'm Irfan currently pursuing my B.Tech degree in CSE from Vellore Institute Of Technology
            (Vellore).ðŸŽ“
            Ever since I was a little kid, software development has been my passion. I still remember sitting in front
            of an old computer of my dad and making it print"Hello, World" for the very first time. As I went through
            the BASIC tutorial, it was almost magic, being able to get the computer to do whatever I wanted, just by
            typing in these funny little symbols, limited only by my own imagination and ingenuity.
            This passion carried me through my education at VIT. Here there are more resources available to me than I
            ever could have imagined as a kid. I am studying new languages, algorithms, compilers, higher mathematics,
            all with pretty much the same fascination that drove me as a kid. And it is here that I learned truly how
            much there is yet to learn.
            I aspire to pursue a job in a competitive environment that will challenge me to push my boundaries and
            expand my knowledge in the field of computer science.
