                <h2>Understanding the Domain</h2>
                <p>Data storage done on physical servers would often pose a lot of threat to it. To safeguard the data
                    from
                    such
                    threats and high maintenance costs, data was shifted to cloud storage platforms.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cloud is generally fast, reliable. But,</li>
                        <li>Security, data mining, centralization concerns remain</li>
                        <li>Providers spent billions on capital.</li>
                        <li>90% of drives are 33% utilized</li>
                    </ul>
                    The cost of hard drives has decreased by about 50 percent (dollar-per-gb) over last 5 years
                    BUT - the price of cloud storage has ﬂatlined for the past ﬁve years

            <p><span class="col">Decentralized cloud storage</span> is one such repository wherein data is stored
                into
                multiple nodes
                (computers).
                Files are broken and spread across multiple nodes by a process known as sharding.

                <span class="col">The blockchain based file storage</span> is maintained by a peer-to-peer network
                like
                any
                other blockchain
                networks. The network is a collection of devices(nodes) that are interconnected to one another.
                Nodes
                are
                individual computers that take in input and performs a function on them and gives an output.In
                Decentralised
                Cloud StorageNode Operators are paid for their unused storage and bandwidth,making decentralized
                storage
                possible for customers. The blockchain uses a special kind of network called “peer-to-peer network”
                which
                encrypts and partitions its entire cloud data between participants, who are all equally privileged,
                called
                “peers”. There is no longer one central server, now there are several distributed and decentralized
                peers.

                        <strong>Remote Access :</strong>
                        Being part of the cloud storage network, it surely offers users the ability to access their
                        data
                        remotely.

                        <strong>Minimal Threat :</strong>
                        Being on the decentralized network means that the centralized network no longer holds the
                        control
                        over everything. Instead, every node performs decisions independently.Because of this
                        feature of
                        such platforms, it gets difficult for hackers to attack the user’s data.

                        <strong>Bandwidth :</strong>
                        Due to the multi-server available for downloads, the bandwidths are very high in
                        decentralized

            <h2> NEED OF A DECENTRALIZED CLOUDS: </h2>
            <p>
                The real issue with centralized providers like Amazon… all of your data resides in huge data
                centers. If
                a
                part of Amazon’s network goes down, you won’t be able to access your data at best, and at worst,
                your
                data
                could be permanently lost or damaged. Large data centers are also vulnerable to hackers, as we’ve
                seen
                time
                and time again. With decentralized cloud storage, end-to-end encryption is standard on every
                file-each
                file
                is encrypted on a user’s computer before it’s uploaded, broken into pieces, and then spread out to
                uncorrelated Nodes across our network. Only you have access to the encryption keys, making it
                virtually
                impossible for your data to be compromised or stolen.
                Plus, centralized cloud storage costs a lot more than our decentralized network. Large data centers
                cost
                a
                ton of money and take a lot of resources to operate. The fact we don’t have to spend money operating
                a
                data
                center, but rather use individual, privately owned devices, means we pass those savings onto our
                customers.

            <h2>Problem Statement Example: Proof of File Integrity</h2>
            <p>
                <h4>Challenge:</h4> Ensuring that a document is authentic and has not been altered
                <h4>Solution:</h4> A hash-output of a ﬁle is stored on the blockchain, creating a cryptographic
                proof
                that a
                ﬁle has
                not been altered since a speciﬁc point in time.
                The blockchain is an immutable, public datastore well-suited for cryptographic timestamping proofs
                for
                any
                ﬁle / digital content Where as in the centralized networking storage systems this level of security
                and
                integrity of our data is not possible.
