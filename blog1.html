            The blockchain based file storage is maintained by a peer-to-peer network like any other blockchain networks. The network is a collection of devices(nodes) that are interconnected to one another. Nodes are individual computers that take in input and performs a function on them and gives an output.In Decentralised Cloud StorageNode Operators are paid for their unused storage and bandwidth,making decentralized storage possible for customers. The blockchain uses a special kind of network called “peer-to-peer network” which encrypts and partitions its entire cloud data between participants, who are all equally privileged, called “peers”. There is no longer one central server, now there are several distributed and decentralized peers.

        <h2>Advantages of Decentralized Cloud Storage:</h2>
        <p>
            <ul class="list-remove-bullet">
                <li class="list-remove-bullets">
                    <strong>Remote Access :</strong>
                    Being part of the cloud storage network, it surely offers users the ability to access their data remotely.

                <li class="list-remove-bullets">
                    <strong>Minimal Threat :</strong>
                    Being on the decentralized network means that the centralized network no longer holds the control over everything. Instead, every node performs decisions independently.Because of this feature of such platforms, it gets difficult for hackers to attack the user’s data.

                <li class="list-remove-bullets">
                    <strong>Bandwidth :</strong>
                    Due to the multi-server available for downloads, the bandwidths are very high in decentralized cloud storages.

        <h2> NEED OF A DECENTRALIZED CLOUDS: </h2>
        <p>
            The real issue with centralized providers like Amazon… all of your data resides in huge data centers. If a part of Amazon’s network goes down, you won’t be able to access your data at best, and at worst, your data could be permanently lost or damaged. Large data centers are also vulnerable to hackers, as we’ve seen time and time again. With decentralized cloud storage, end-to-end encryption is standard on every file-each file is encrypted on a user’s computer before it’s uploaded, broken into pieces, and then spread out to uncorrelated Nodes across our network. Only you have access to the encryption keys, making it virtually impossible for your data to be compromised or stolen.
Plus, centralized cloud storage costs a lot more than our decentralized network. Large data centers cost a ton of money and take a lot of resources to operate. The fact we don’t have to spend money operating a data center, but rather use individual, privately owned devices, means we pass those savings onto our customers.
